Hi there! I’m a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Astrophysics at the California Institute of Technology, advised by [Kareem El-Badry](https://kareemelbadry.github.io/).
My research studies how **stars form, interact, and evolve in multiple-star systems**, particularly binaries and triples.

I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and observation. On the theoretical side, I model the long-term evolution of binary and triple star systems using detailed simulations and population synthesis frameworks. I am equally interested in confronting these models with the real world: testing predictions against observations and letting them inform one another. On the observational side, I utilize data from ground- and space-based facilities, including *Gaia*, *JWST*, *HST*, Palomar, and Keck, and especially enjoy exploring publicly available surveys.

Outside of astronomy, I spend most of my time playing basketball and tennis, skateboarding, and generally being outdoors.

I am always happy to chat, so don’t hesitate to reach out: **cshariat@caltech.edu**.
