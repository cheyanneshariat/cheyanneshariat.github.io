Hi there! I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Astrophysics at the California Institute of Technology, advised by [Kareem El-Badry](https://kareemelbadry.github.io/) and often working closely with [Smadar Naoz](https://snaoz.astro.ucla.edu/) (UCLA).

My research focuses on the **formation and evolution of multiple-star systems**, particularly binaries and triples. Triple star systems are [common](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137i4201S/abstract) and dynamically rich, offering a natural laboratory for studying [stellar interactions](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...978...47S/abstract), [population evolution](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955L..14S/abstract), and the origins of [exotic](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...983..115S/abstract) [stellar phenomena](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137g4201S/abstract).

My work lies at the intersection of theory and observation. On the theoretical side, I model the long-term evolution of binary and triple star systems using detailed simulations and population synthesis frameworks. I am equally interested in confronting these models with the real world: testing predictions against observations and letting them inform one another. Observationally, I use data from ground- and space-based facilities -- including Gaia, JWST, HST, Palomar, and Keck -- and especially enjoy exploring large-scale surveys.

I remain broadly interested in various questions in astrophysics, including studying stellar populations in [other galaxies](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250904555S/abstract), measuring the [ages of stars](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251008675S/abstract), and (occasionally) [exoplanets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...964L..13S/abstract).

Outside of astronomy, I spend most of my time playing basketball, tennis, skateboarding, and generally being outside.

I am always happy to chat: feel free to reach out at **cshariat@caltech.edu**.
