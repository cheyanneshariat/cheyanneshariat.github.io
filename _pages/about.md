Hi there! I’m a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Astrophysics at the California Institute of Technology, advised by [Kareem El-Badry](https://kareemelbadry.github.io/).
I study how **stars form, interact, and evolve in multiple-star systems**, particularly binaries and triples.

# Research
The majority of stars have companions, making binary and triple star systems a fundamental component of stellar populations.
My work focuses on understanding the physical processes that shape the evolution of multiple star systems and their population-wide properties.

Triple star systems are [common](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137i4201S/abstract) and dynamically rich, offering a natural laboratory for studying [stellar mergers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...978...47S/abstract), [population evolution](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955L..14S/abstract), and the origins of [exotic](https://astrobites.org/2025/12/22/triple-double-do-merging-white-dwarfs-produce-frb-emitting-remnants/) [stellar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...983..115S/abstract) [phenomena](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137g4201S/abstract). Much of my work on triples is carried out in collaboration with [Smadar Naoz (UCLA)](https://snaoz.astro.ucla.edu/), focusing on how 3-body dynamics couple to stellar evolution and mass transfer.

I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and observation. On the theoretical side, I model the long-term evolution of binary and triple star systems using detailed simulations and population synthesis frameworks. I am equally interested in confronting these models with the real world: testing predictions against observations and letting them inform one another. On the observational side, I use data from ground- and space-based facilities -- including *Gaia*, *JWST*, *HST*, Palomar, and Keck -- and especially enjoy exploring large-scale surveys.

I remain generally curious about various questions across astrophysics, including studying stellar populations in [other galaxies](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250904555S/abstract), measuring precise [stellar ages](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251008675S/abstract), and (occasionally) studying [exoplanets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...964L..13S/abstract).

Outside of astronomy, I spend most of my time playing basketball and tennis, skateboarding, and generally being outdoors.

I am always happy to chat, so don’t hesitate to reach out: **cshariat@caltech.edu**.
