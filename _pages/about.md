I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Astrophysics at the California Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Kareem El-Badry](https://kareemelbadry.github.io/) and often working closely with Prof. [Smadar Naoz](https://snaoz.astro.ucla.edu/) (UCLA).
My research focuses on the formation and evolution of multiple-star systems, particularly triples and binaries. Triple star systems are [common](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137i4201S/abstract), and I'm interested in exploring how their complex dynamics shape the evolution of stellar populations and lead to various exotic stellar phenomena.

I work at the intersection of theory and observation, combining data from ground- and space-based telescopes with detailed three-body simulations and population synthesis models. My projects span a wide range of astrophysical contexts, from stellar multiplicity and compact object formation to studying dwarf extragalactic populations and (sometimes) the formation of exoplanet systems. I'm also constantly exploring large-scale surveys.

My broader goal is to let theory and observation inform each other—using models to interpret data, and data to refine models such that at the end of the day, we learn something new!
