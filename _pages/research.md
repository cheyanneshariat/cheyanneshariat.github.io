The majority of stars have companions, making binary and triple star systems a fundamental component of stellar populations.
My work focuses on understanding the physical processes that shape the evolution of multiple star systems and their population-wide properties.

## Triple star systems
Triples are [common](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137i4201S/abstract) and dynamically rich, offering a natural laboratory for studying [stellar mergers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...978...47S/abstract), [population evolution](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...955L..14S/abstract), and the origins of [exotic](https://astrobites.org/2025/12/22/triple-double-do-merging-white-dwarfs-produce-frb-emitting-remnants/) [stellar](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025ApJ...983..115S/abstract) [phenomena](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025PASP..137g4201S/abstract). Much of my work on triples is carried out in collaboration with [Smadar Naoz (UCLA)](https://snaoz.astro.ucla.edu/), focusing on how 3-body dynamics couple to stellar evolution and mass transfer. 

## Binary star systems
Binaries are ubiquitous and form the inner building blocks of higher-order systems. My work on binaries focuses on the physical processes governing binary evolution, such as constraining the outcomes of [binary mass transfer](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2026arXiv260100439S/abstract). 

## Broader Interests
Alongside these core themes, I remain generally curious about a range of related problems across astrophysics. This includes studying stellar populations in [other galaxies](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250904555S/abstract), measuring precise [stellar ages](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv251008675S/abstract), and (occasionally) studying [exoplanets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...964L..13S/abstract).
